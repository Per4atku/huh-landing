- Run type-checks, lint, and unit tests on every PR (fast fail on errors).
- Unit/component tests: use Vitest or Jest + Testing Library. Snapshot only for stable UI contracts.
- E2E tests: cover critical flows (signup, landing → conversion) with Playwright or Cypress.
- Add a predeploy smoke test to staging that validates critical public pages and sitemap availability.

- Keep dependencies up to date and monitor for vulnerabilities (Dependabot or similar).
- Enforce CSP, X-Frame-Options, and secure cookies on server responses.
- Avoid `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` without sanitization; sanitize any user-provided HTML.
- Treat third-party scripts carefully (analytics, widgets); lazy-load only when needed and sandbox them.

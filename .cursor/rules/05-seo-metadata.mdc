- Use Next's metadata API to set dynamic title/description/og:image per page.
- Generate and keep an up-to-date sitemap.xml + robots.txt for public pages.
- Use static (SSG) rendering for marketing/landing pages when possible to improve crawlability.
- Add structured data (JSON-LD) on product/landing pages when it provides value.

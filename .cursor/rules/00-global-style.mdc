- Use TypeScript for all new files. Prefer explicit return types for exported functions/components.
- Enforce ESLint + Prettier rules; run `npm run lint` and `npm run format` in CI.
- Avoid `any`. If a one-off `any` is used, add a short inline justification comment.
- Prefer named exports for components and utilities; default exports only for top-level pages.
- Keep functions < 60 lines when possible; split complex logic into hooks or utils.
- Prefer composable hooks (`useXxx`) over prop-drilling. Use `useMemo`/`useCallback` only to prevent real performance problems.

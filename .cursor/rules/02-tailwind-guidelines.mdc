- Define design tokens (colors, spacing, typography) in `tailwind.config.js` and reference them, avoid hard-coded hexs in components.
- Use `@apply` in component CSS/utility classes for repeated patterns to reduce class duplication.
- Favor semantic wrapper classes (e.g., `btn`, `container`) that combine utilities in one place.
- Adopt mobile-first responsive classes; keep a predictable breakpoint strategy.
- Keep long class lists reasonable — extract repeating patterns into small components or `className` helpers.

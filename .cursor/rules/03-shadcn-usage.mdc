- Treat shadcn components as base primitives. Do NOT edit generated shadcn component files directly—wrap or extend them via wrapper components.
- Keep UI primitives under `src/components/ui/*` and project-specific components under `src/components/*`.
- Use shadcn's `components.json` and `npx shadcn@latest add` flow for updates; prefer variants and props over copying modifications.
- When customizing styles, use Tailwind tokens and `className` composition (not direct file edits) so updates are easy.
